>üìã Images, captured by a camera, play a critical role in training Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Usually, we assume the images acquired by cameras are consistent with the ones perceived by human eyes. However, due to the different physical mechanisms between human-vision and computer-vision systems, the final perceived images could be very different in some cases, for example shooting on digital monitors. In this work, we find a special phenomenon in digital image processing, the moir√© effect, that could cause unnoticed security threats to DNNs. Based on it, we propose a Moir√© Attack (MA) that generates the physical-world moir√© pattern adding to the images by mimicking the shooting process of digital devices. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed digital Moir√© Attack (MA) is a perfect camouflage for attackers to tamper with DNNs with a high success rate (100.0% for untargeted and 97.0% for targeted attack when the noise budget Œµ=4), high transferability rate across different models, and high robustness under various defenses. Furthermore, MA is with great stealthiness because the moir√© effect is unavoidable due to the camera's inner physical structure, which therefore hardly attracts the awareness of humans.

## Requirements
We need torch >= 1.4, torchattacks = 2.12.2, colour-demosaicing = 0.1.6, colour-science = 0.3.16

## Create an environment
creat a virtual environment:
```
conda create -n Moire_Attack_env python=3.7
source activate Moire_Attack_env
```

To install requirements:
```
pip install [Package = version]
```

## Demo
#### Download the dataset [[Link](https://github.com/RjDuan/AdvDrop)] and add it to 'Moire_Attack/data/'
#### Quick Start

Start with an example with: 

```
python Moire_Attack.py
```
* Detailed parameter can be adjusted in Moire_Attack.py

## Experiment Results

#### Here is an example of the generated adversarial example using Moire_Attack:
* Adversarial examples of untargeted MA:
